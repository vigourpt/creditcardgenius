    <h2>Understanding Daily vs Monthly Credit Card Interest</h2>
    <p>When it comes to credit card interest, the calculation method can significantly impact how much you pay. Let's explore both daily and monthly interest calculations.</p>

    <div class="cta-box bg-indigo-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-indigo-900 mb-4">Calculate Your Interest Costs</h3>

    </div>

    <h3>Daily Interest Calculation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>APR divided by 365 = Daily Periodic Rate (DPR)</li>
      <li>Interest charged on daily balance</li>
      <li>More precise calculation method</li>
      <li>Usually results in slightly higher charges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Monthly Interest Calculation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>APR divided by 12 = Monthly Periodic Rate</li>
      <li>Interest charged on average monthly balance</li>
      <li>Simpler calculation method</li>
      <li>May result in slightly lower charges</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Real-World Example Comparison</h3>
    <p>Let's compare both methods with a $1,000 balance and 18.99% APR:</p>

    <h4>Daily Method:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>DPR = 18.99% ÷ 365 = 0.052%</li>
      <li>Daily Interest = $1,000 × 0.052% = $0.52</li>
      <li>Monthly Total = $0.52 × 30 = $15.60</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Monthly Method:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Monthly Rate = 18.99% ÷ 12 = 1.58%</li>
      <li>Monthly Interest = $1,000 × 1.58% = $15.83</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact on Your Finances</h3>
    <p>The difference between methods can add up over time, especially with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Higher balances</li>
      <li>Variable payment dates</li>
      <li>Multiple purchases throughout the month</li>
      <li>Partial payments</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bg-yellow-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-900 mb-2">Important Consideration</h4>
      <p class="text-yellow-800">Most credit card issuers use the daily balance method, which can result in higher interest charges but provides more accurate calculations.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Strategies to Minimize Interest</h3>
    <p>Regardless of calculation method, you can reduce interest by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Making payments early in the billing cycle</li>
      <li>Paying more than the minimum</li>
      <li>Making multiple payments per month</li>
      <li>Taking advantage of grace periods</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
      <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-900 mb-2">Pro Tip</h4>
      <p class="text-blue-800">Making multiple smaller payments throughout the month can reduce your average daily balance more effectively than a single monthly payment.</p>
